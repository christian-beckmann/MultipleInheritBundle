[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/megogo/MultipleInheritanceBundle.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/igorynia/MultipleInheritanceBundle)

This bundle aims to provide the missing Symfony 2 functionality, when multiple child bundles inherits from one parent.
As an example, here is the task of building sites-satellites, when you have the main site,
and sites hosted on subdomains, in which need to be changed some templates and/or part of the logic in the controllers.

## Requirements
* [PHP][@php] 5.3.3 and up
* [Symfony][@symfony] 2.2 or higher
